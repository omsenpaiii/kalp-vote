## Smart Contract

The smart contract for **Kalp Medika** is built using the **KRC721** token standard provided by **Kalp Studio**. The KRC721 template ensures that each medicine is represented as a unique, non-fungible token (NFT), allowing precise tracking and ownership verification throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain.

### Contract Details

- **Token Standard**: KRC721 (Non-Fungible Token)
- **Blockchain**: Kalp DLT
- **Contract Address**: `yvZCOXuc2Zlpz3KQn8KLb6101k5K3Dco1727003890680`
- **Network**: Kalp DLT Testnet

### Features

- **Medicine Tracking**: Each medicine is represented by a unique KRC721 token, allowing transparent tracking across all stakeholders, including manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies.
- **Immutable Data**: Information about the medicine's origin, expiry date, and movement in the supply chain is permanently stored on the blockchain.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Medicine ownership can be transferred from one entity to another, ensuring full traceability across the supply chain.
  
### Interaction with the Smart Contract

The app interacts with the KRC721 smart contract to:

- Mint new tokens for each batch of medicine.
- Burn tokens for old/damaged batch of medicine.
- Transfer ownership as the medicine moves across the supply chain.
- Query the contract for tracking details and ownership verification.

You can explore and interact with the deployed contract via the **Kalp Studio** blockchain explorer or integrate with the app using the contract address.
